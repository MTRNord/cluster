  # Available for imageFormat: "2". Older releases of CSI RBD
  # support only the `layering` feature. The Linux kernel (KRBD) supports the
  # full complement of features as of 5.4
  # `layering` alone corresponds to Ceph's bitfield value of "2" ;
  # `layering` + `fast-diff` + `object-map` + `deep-flatten` + `exclusive-lock` together
  # correspond to Ceph's OR'd bitfield value of "63". Here we use
  # a symbolic, comma-separated format:

  #imageFeatures: layering,fast-diff,object-map,deep-flatten,exclusive-lock
  # For 5.3 or earlier kernels:
